# FiveM_TimeAndDateSync
Scammer made a script that synced time for everyone and I'm simply taking that idea further to sync date also.

Most if not all of the credit here goes to Scammer. I just used his timesync script and added the month/day/year aspect into it. I took into account leap year so it is scripted as if it was a real calender.
